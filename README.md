# data-mining-on-marketing-campaign

Welcome to the Customer Data Analysis Project! In this project, we aim to analyze the data of a company's customers using the Marketing Campaign dataset available on Kaggle.

## Marketing Campaign Dataset
We utilize the [Marketing Campaign dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign) from Kaggle to perform our analysis. This dataset contains valuable information that will help us gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## Project Phases

This project consists of two main phases:

### 1. Knowledge of Datasets and Preprocessing
In this initial phase, we focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. We will perform various data preprocessing tasks to prepare the data for analysis.

### 2. Pattern Analysis and Presentation of Prediction Models
In the second phase, we extract meaningful patterns from the data. Additionally, we train multiple classification models using the prepared data and evaluate their performance using appropriate criteria. This phase will provide valuable insights and predictive models for decision-making.
